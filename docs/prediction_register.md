# Predictions recorded before the result

Written before the measurement, so the record cannot be rewritten afterwards. Four of the
predictions below were wrong, which is the reason this file exists: without it, a refuted guess
quietly becomes a "finding we always suspected".

## Open

**P5 — crouch trackability is set by knee excursion (registered 2026-08-18, 2 of 3 cells pending).**
Motion 005's crouch at 0.994 rad is accepted; x000's at 1.000 rad — sitting exactly on the cap — is
rejected for pure reference drift with zero contact, at 0.225 m/s against the accepted crouch's
0.100. If excursion is the governing variable, then **x002 (0.929 rad) and x003 (0.936 rad) should
both be accepted**, and the crouch's boundary sits just under 1.00 rad.

*Confidence: moderate, and deliberately stated because the analogous prediction failed for the arm
tuck.* Excursion did **not** predict tuck trackability there. What differs is the failure mode: the
tuck's rejections are collisions at low drift (0.051 and 0.003 m/s), while the crouch's is a
tracking failure with no contact at all — and a tracking failure is the kind of thing excursion
plausibly governs, where a collision is governed by geometry. If x002 or x003 is rejected, excursion
is not the variable for the crouch either, and per-clip rollout screening is the only method for
both operators.

## Resolved

| # | prediction | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | The arm tuck will track better than the crouch because it moves less mass | **wrong** — it holds the route (19.6 mm) but loses the effect, and yields 1 of 3 |
| P2 | Lower joint excursion improves retention | **wrong** — the smallest excursion gave the worst retention |
| P3 | Clip duration dominates trackability | **wrong** — refuted alongside P2 |
| P4 | The tuck fails by pressing the wrist into the hip | **wrong** — the gap is negative on every nominal and its change anti-correlates with the verdict; the failures are external contact, not self-contact |

The pattern in P1–P4 is one thing: each was an attempt to *infer* trackability from the clip instead
of measuring it. That is also what forced `family_eligible` out of the Stage 2 report after four
estimators gave four answers. P5 is the same species of claim, which is why it is registered rather
than assumed.
